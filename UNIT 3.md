#### 36.1.1. Introduction to Strings
Strings in python are represented with prefixing and suffixing the characters with quotation marks (either single quotes (') or double quotes (")).
- Characters in a string are accessed using an index which is an integer (either positive or negative).
- It starts from 0 to n-1, where n is the number of characters in a string.
- Strings are immutable which means contents cannot be changed once they are created.

The function input() in python is a string by default.


Write a code snippet that prompts the user to input a string using the input() function and print the entered string as shown in the sample test case.

**Sample Input and Output:**

````str: Strings in Python are immutable````

````Strings in Python are immutable````

````python
str=input("str: ")
print(str)


````
