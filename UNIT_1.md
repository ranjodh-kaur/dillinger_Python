Language is a tool for communication.

In this learning program, we use English to give instructions and share information with learners.

Similarly, computer programming languages communicate with computers by providing instructions.

These Programming languages help us represent data like numbers, text, and images and also provide instructions to work with that data.

You don't need to be a computer science expert or a math genius to write a computer program. If you understand basic logic, you can write computer programs easily.

There are many programming languages available. In our course, we will learn a programming language called Python.

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language for general-purpose programming.

In English, to greet someone, you say "Hello!". Similarly in Spanish, one would say "Hola!".

For example, if we want the computer to display a greeting message, we provide instructions in a computer programming language. In Python we provide instructions in the below format
print("Hello!")
The above text is called source code or simply code. Since it is written in Python, it is called Python code.

The above code represents a simple Python program which prints "Hello!".

In the above case, we have provided some instructions in a computer programming language to the computer to display a greeting message. This sequence of instructions is called a program.
